# Indian Railways Database Management System
This project involves the design and implementation of a comprehensive database system for Indian Railways, covering multiple aspects such as user management, railway operations, ticket bookings, and customer services. The goal was to create a robust and efficient system that models the complex relationships between different entities involved in railway management while ensuring seamless data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.

## Project Overview
To begin with, an Entity-Relationship (E-R) diagram was designed to visually represent the key components of the system and their interconnections. This included entities such as users , trains , routes , stations , tickets , and customer support . The diagram effectively captured the cardinality constraints and functional dependencies among various components, ensuring a well-structured and normalized database design.

Once the conceptual design was finalized, the E-R model was transformed into a relational schema, which was then implemented using PostgreSQL 🐘, a powerful open-source relational database management system. The database schema included primary and foreign key constraints, normalization techniques, and indexes for efficient query performance.

To support real-world railway operations, various SQL queries and procedures were developed to facilitate:

✅ User Management: Registering new users, managing authentication, and handling user roles (passengers, railway staff, and administrators).
✅ Train and Route Management: Storing information about trains , routes, schedules, and station connectivity.
✅ Ticket Booking and Cancellation: Enabling users to book tickets , view seat availability , and process cancellations with dynamic updates to the database.
✅ Customer Service Management: Handling customer complaints, feedback, and inquiries through structured data handling.
✅ Operational Queries: Retrieving train schedules, finding optimal routes , and monitoring reservation statuses.

The project demonstrates a strong understanding of relational database concepts  while ensuring data integrity, security , and optimized query performance . The implementation of efficient indexing and query optimization techniques ensures scalability, making the system capable of handling large volumes of data  and concurrent user requests.
